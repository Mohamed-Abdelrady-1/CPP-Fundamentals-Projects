C++ Fundamentals Course Projects 

This repository contains my capstone projects for the C++ Fundamentals Level 1 Course. These projects demonstrate my understanding of structured programming, logic building, and memory management.

Projects Overview

1. Grade Analyzer System 
A program that takes student grades as input and generates a performance report.
Features: Calculates average, max/min grades, and counts passed/failed subjects.
Concepts: Arrays, Loops, Structs, Aggregate Functions.

2. The Math Tool 
A multi-functional calculator tool.
Features: Checks for Prime numbers, calculates Factorials, and Sums digits.
Concepts: Switch menus, Do-While loops, Complex Algorithms, and Input Validation.

3. Secure ATM System 
A simulation of a banking ATM interface with security features.
Features: Login System: Secure PIN entry with a 3-attempt limit (Lockout mechanism).
Balance Management: Real-time updates using **Pass by Reference.
Validation: Prevents negative deposits or overdraft withdrawals.
Concepts: Reference Parameters, Enums, Modular Programming, Business Logic Implementation.
